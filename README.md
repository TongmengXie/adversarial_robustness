# adversarial_robustness

This repository contains resources and code related to adversarial robustness in machine learning models. The primary focus is on techniques and experiments to evaluate and improve the robustness of models against adversarial attacks.

## Contents

- `TextAttack.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating adversarial attacks and defenses using the TextAttack library. This notebook includes examples of generating adversarial examples, evaluating model robustness, and applying defense strategies.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Python installed along with the necessary dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/TongmengXie/adversarial_robustness.git
   cd adversarial_robustness
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (If a `requirements.txt` file is not present, install dependencies manually as needed, e.g., `textattack`.)

### Usage

Open the `TextAttack.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to explore the adversarial attack experiments. The notebook contains step-by-step instructions and code cells to run attacks and analyze results.
